ms_gui_mouseAtlas:
It just needs the annotation nii-file and the regions.mat. Both are loaded in the "opening function". Change the corresponding lines to your need!
Its main purpose is to create ROI masks. Just select from the node tree the needed ROI(s) and click "Update". It can take some time till all the needed info are loaded!
You will see the visualization of the selected ROI(s). BUT: this is just a visual feedback! The matlab function isosurface is used which is not really a good function to visualize small structures, but the best we have.
If everything seems to be correct the ROI mask can be created by "create Atlas". A .nii annotation file is created (name: atlas_DATE.nii) and a corresponding txt file which contains the linkage between number and ROI name.
